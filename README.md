# Dark Mode

[Dark Mode](https://wordpress.org/plugins/dark-mode/) is a plugin for WordPress that lets your users turn the website dashboard into a nicer, easier on the eyes style. For people who work best at night that don't want sore eyes.

Dark Mode did use to be a featured (beta) plugin for WordPress but the direction of the plugin has since changed.
